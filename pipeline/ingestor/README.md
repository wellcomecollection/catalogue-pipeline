# test_documents folder

This folder contains a collection of randomly generated documents that look like
the documents in the API index.

They're meant for use in the API tests -- these JSON files get copied into the
API repo, then they can be loaded into an Elasticsearch index to ensure the API
can query them correctly.

These files are automatically generated by the ingestor tests.  Don't edit them
manually -- update the tests, then re-run them to generate new documents.

NOTE: test documents whose file name starts with `images.examples.color-filter-tests` and `images.similar-features` are not generated automatically by running the tests. They're picked up from the ES index and copied over here, due to the complexity of creating random but meaningful colour vectors.
