# test_documents

This folder contains a collection of randomly generated documents that look like
the documents in the API index.

They're meant for use in the API tests -- these JSON files get copied into the
API repo, then they can be loaded into an Elasticsearch index to ensure the API
can query them correctly.

These files are automatically generated by the ingestor tests.  Don't edit them
manually -- update the tests, then re-run them to generate new documents.
