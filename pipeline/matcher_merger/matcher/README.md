# matcher

Some objects have records in multiple catalogues.
For example, a book might have an entry in Sierra (the library catalogue) and a METS file (for the digitised version).
We want to combine these records into a single work.

The matcher constructs a graph of all the connections between works, which we can use to work out which Works should be
merged together.
For example, here's a graph of five works:

![A graph containing five nodes â€“ a set of two and a set of three. Each node has a source name (Sierra, Miro, METS) and a catalogue identifier (e.g. b11077888). Two of the nodes also have thumbnail images to help us spot the record. The sets of two/three nodes are linked by arrows, showing which record is creating the link.](dunrz35z.png)

Although there are five source records, we can see that these should be combined into two merged works:

* One work made from Sierra b11077888 and Miro M0005577
* One work made from Sierra b10546595, Sierra b32888491, and METS b32888491

The links are populated in the transformers â€“ for example, the Sierra transformer will have created a work that says *"
Sierra b11077888 should be linked with Miro M0005577"*.
The matcher combines these links into a single graph.

The links from the transformers are transitive and may or may not be defined at both ends.
e.g. in the example above Sierra:b10546595 knows nothing of METS:b32888491.  
However, they are still combined into a single graph, regardless of which one
of the three documents is currently being processed.

The list of affected documents is then sent to the [merger](../merger/README.md).
The list's order should not be important (though it may be used as a tiebreaker),
The distinction between target and source records is determined within the merger itself.

## Debugging the matcher

The visual graphs (like the one above) are useful for debugging the matcher, if somebody asks why two works have (or
haven't) been matched together.

To view a matcher graph, use the script in this directory:

```
cd ./scripts
yarn
yarn getMatcherGraph [catalogueId]
```
