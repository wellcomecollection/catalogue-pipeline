Subjects are derived from 6xx fields which correspond to different "flavours" of subject.

A Subject is made up of one or more Concepts. When the types of those Concepts correspond to types used elsewhere
the rules for deriving their labels are subtly different. Some of the subfields in a Subject correspond to the Subject
as a whole, rather than the Concept within the subject.
