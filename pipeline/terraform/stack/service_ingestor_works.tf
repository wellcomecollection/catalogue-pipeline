  # configure this value separately for the two scenarios

  # This number may be subject to some refinement.  This is a bit under three hours, which, when considered
  # alongside the 0200 Sierra Harvest (which is the situation where runaway ingestion has happened),

  # ask for it to be processed again.  As a result, if this system goes over capacity to this extent, each message
  # will be processed max_receive_count times, which means going even further over capacity
  # As with message_retention, there is no need to maintain two different configurations. In normal running,
  # we want to protect the database from overloading by pushing messages onto the DLQ on first failure.
  # During a reindex, it is under human supervision, and we can easily redrive the DLQ if required (and often do).

    # gum up the ingestor: it throws an OOM, the messages get retried,
    # it throws another OOM.  Continue until messages go to the DLQ.
