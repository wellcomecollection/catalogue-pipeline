# Merger

## What

Merges records that refer to the same object

See [matcher](../matcher/README.md) for more rationale.

## How

* The [matcher](../matcher/README.md) provides a message containing a list of identifiers
  of "matched" records.
* The merger determines which record is the "target", according to [precedence](
  src/main/scala/weco/pipeline/merger/rules/TargetPrecedence.scala)
* The merger extracts the relevant fields from each record, and merges the values onto the "main" record according to
  the [rules](src/main/scala/weco/pipeline/merger/rules)
* The updated main record is written into the merged index.
* Redirect entries for each of the used records are also written into the merged index.
* The downstream stage is notified about the changed records
