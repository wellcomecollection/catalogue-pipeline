    * availabilities of its descendents, as well as its own.
    *
    * Note that this only covers *known* descendents.  e.g. if the works have
    * paths (A, A/B/1), then A will not inherit availabilities from A/B/1 --
    * the intermediate path A/B is missing.
    *
    * This preserves the original behaviour of the relation embedder, but it's
    * not clear if it's intentional -- it was a side effect of the implementation,
    * not something that was explicitly tested.
