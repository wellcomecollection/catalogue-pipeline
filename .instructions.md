# Repository Instructions for GitHub Copilot

This repository contains the Wellcome Collection catalogue pipeline, which processes and indexes cultural heritage metadata.

## Project Structure

This is a mixed-language repository containing:

- **Python projects**: Located in `catalogue_graph/`, `pipeline/inferrer/*/`, and various adapter directories
- **Scala projects**: Located throughout the repository, built with SBT

## Python Development Guidelines

### Package Management
- **Always use UV** for Python package management and dependency resolution
- Python projects use `pyproject.toml` for configuration and `uv.lock` for dependency locking
- Do not use pip, poetry, or pipenv - UV is the standard tool

### Python Project Structure
- Python projects follow the structure defined in [RFC 071-python_builds](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/docs/tree/main/rfcs/071-python_builds), which standardizes:
  - UV for dependency management with `pyproject.toml` configuration
  - `.python-version` files to define Python versions consistently 
  - Shared code within repositories treated as installable libraries
  - Common build patterns for Docker images and Lambda packages
- Dependencies are managed through `pyproject.toml` with development dependencies in `[dependency-groups]`
- Use `uv export` to generate requirements files when needed
- Use `uv pip install` for installing dependencies with platform-specific requirements

### Build and Deployment
- Python projects are typically packaged as Lambda functions or container images
- Build scripts use UV commands like:
  - `uv export --no-dev --format=requirements-txt`
  - `uv pip install --python-platform x86_64-manylinux2014 --target <dir> --only-binary=:all:`

### Testing and Quality
- Use pytest for testing
- Code formatting and linting tools are configured in `pyproject.toml`
- Many projects include ruff for linting and formatting
- Type checking with mypy where configured

## Scala Development

- Scala projects use SBT for build management
- Follow existing patterns in the repository for Scala code organization

## CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflows are configured for both Python and Scala projects
- Python workflows use the `wellcomecollection/.github/.github/actions/python_check@main` action
- Scala projects have their own CI configurations

When working on this repository, always check the specific project structure and follow the existing patterns for the technology stack you're working with.
