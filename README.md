# Catalogue Graph

Experimental repository for building a knowledge graph from catalogue concepts and works. The main goals are to:
* Experiment with AWS Neptune and explore its features and potential limitations
* Provision infrastructure for a knowledge graph pipeline
* Write an initial pipeline in Python for populating the knowledge graph with concepts (LoC, MeSH, Wikidata)

Eventually the contents of this repository might be merged into another repository, such as catalogue-pipeline or concepts-pipeline. 

See the following RFCs for more context:
* [RFC 062: Wellcome Collection Graph overview and next steps](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/docs/tree/main/rfcs/062-knowledge-graph)
* [RFC 064: Graph data model](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/docs/blob/rfc-064-graph-model/rfcs/064-graph-data-model/README.md)
