# Miro Links Script

This script is used to find links between Miro images that have been
individually re-catalogued in Calm and their source Sierra work.

The works from Calm contain a related material note that links to the
work page for the Sierra work. This script looks up the associated B
number for that work and creates a CSV file that contains work IDs,
Calm AltRefNos and Sierra B nUmbers for all re-catalogued images.

The output CSV file is then loaded manually into Sierra to create
notes with reciprocal links on the Sierra bibs.
