# CALM adapter

CALM is our archive catalogue.
The CALM adapter fetches new records from CALM and keeps our copy of the CALM database up-to-date.

## Key services/libraries

*   The `calm_api_client` library is a generic client for the CALM API.
    It's a SOAP API that allows you to query CALM records.
    As of January 2022, we do not have a working link to CALM API documentation (ðŸ˜¬).

*   The `calm_adapter` service fetches updated records from CALM.

    It receives queries from the `calm_window_generator`, which tell it what sort of records to fetch.
    e.g.

    ```json
    {
      "start": "2001-01-01T01:00:00",
      "end":   "2002-02-02T02:00:00",
      "type": "CreatedOrModifiedDate"
    }
    ```

    This query tells the `calm_adapter` service to fetch any records which were updated between 1 Jan 2001 and 2 Feb 2002.

    The window generator can query based on created date, modified date, or the RefNo if you want to get updates for specific records.

    The window generator runs as a Lambda on a fixed schedule, or it can be run locally if you want to do a one-off query.

    TODO: Rename this to "query generator".

*   When records are deleted from CALM, they disappear immediately.
    They no longer appear in the API.

    Because we want to spot when records are deleted, we have the `calm_deletion_checker` that polls CALM to look for deleted records (by looking for every record we know about, and checking if it's still in the API).
    It's triggered by the `calm_deletion_check_initiator`.

*   The `calm_indexer` service indexes CALM records in the reporting cluster.
    This is meant for ad hoc analysis of the CALM data, e.g. when designing a new transformation rule.
