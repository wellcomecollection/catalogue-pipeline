/** Represents the position of an individual work in a hierarchy.
  *
  * @param path  The internal control field that describes the position of a
  *              Work within the hierarchy
  * @param label The path we'll display as publicly visible on /works
  *
  * Note that these two don't have to be the same (although they often are).
  *
  * e.g. in Calm the path is the RefNo, the label is the AltRefNo.  A work could
  * have the RefNo PPDAL/E/2/13/1 but the AltRefNo PP/DAL/E/2/13/1 -- because the
  * top-level item of the hierarchy is PPDAL (personal papers of A G Dally), not PP.
