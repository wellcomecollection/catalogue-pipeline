/** When merging lists of relations, all identified relations are preserved, but

  * knows the title of a given relation, but a later stage then then finds that
  * same relation using an identifier. In that case, the newer, identifier-based
  * one supersedes the older name-only one.
  *
  * Sometimes, that early name-only relation is not identified later, so should
  * be preserved.
  *
  * A concrete example of this is where a Sierra document contains a 773 field.
  * During transformation, we do not know whether this will result in it
  * becoming a member of a Series or a Hierarchy, because that distinction is
  * driven by the presence of a reciprocal 774 relationship on the parent.
  *
  * So, during the transformer phase, a candidate Series ancestor is created.
  * If, during the relation embedder phase, the other end is found, then the
  * Series ancestor is to be discarded.
